>1
Write the code, one line for each action:

>Create an empty object user.
>Add the property name with the value John.
>Add the property surname with the value Smith.
>Change the value of the name to Pete.
>Remove the property name from the object.

SOLUTION:
let user = {};
user.name = "John";
user.surname = "Smith";
user.name = "Pete";
delete user.name;

>2
Write the function isEmpty(obj) which returns true if the object has no properties, false otherwise.

Should work like that:

let schedule = {};

alert( isEmpty(schedule) ); // true

schedule["8:30"] = "get up";

alert( isEmpty(schedule) ); // false

SOLUTION:
Just loop over the object and return false immediately if thereâ€™s at least one property.

function isEmpty(obj) {
  for (let key in obj) {
    // if the loop has started, there is a property
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
