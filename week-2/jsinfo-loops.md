>1
let i = 3;

while (i) {
  alert( i-- );
}
SOLUTION:
let i = 3;

alert(i--); // shows 3, decreases i to 2

alert(i--) // shows 2, decreases i to 1

alert(i--) // shows 1, decreases i to 0

// done, while(i) check stops the loop

>The prefix form ++i:

let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i );

>The postfix form i++

let i = 0;
while (i++ < 5) alert( i );
SOLUTION:
The task demonstrates how postfix/prefix forms can lead to different results when used in comparisons.

From 1 to 4

 let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i );
The first value is i = 1, because ++i first increments i and then returns the new value. So the first comparison is 1 < 5 and the alert shows 1.

Then follow 2, 3, 4… – the values show up one after another. The comparison always uses the incremented value, because ++ is before the variable.

Finally, i = 4 is incremented to 5, the comparison while(5 < 5) fails, and the loop stops. So 5 is not shown.

From 1 to 5

 let i = 0;
while (i++ < 5) alert( i );
The first value is again i = 1. The postfix form of i++ increments i and then returns the old value, so the comparison i++ < 5 will use i = 0 (contrary to ++i < 5).

But the alert call is separate. It’s another statement which executes after the increment and the comparison. So it gets the current i = 1.

Then follow 2, 3, 4…

Let’s stop on i = 4. The prefix form ++i would increment it and use 5 in the comparison. But here we have the postfix form i++. So it increments i to 5, but returns the old value. Hence the comparison is actually while(4 < 5) – true, and the control goes on to alert.

The value i = 5 is the last one, because on the next step while(5 < 5) is false.

The postfix form:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
The prefix form:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );

SOLUTION:

from 0 to 4 in both cases.

 for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
That can be easily deducted from the algorithm of for:

Execute once i = 0 before everything (begin).
Check the condition i < 5
If true – execute the loop body alert(i), and then i++
The increment i++ is separated from the condition check (2). That’s just another statement.

The value returned by the increment is not used here, so there’s no difference between i++ and ++i.

>4
Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10.

SOLUTION:
for (let i = 2; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    alert( i );
  }
}
We use the “modulo” operator % to get the remainder and check for the evenness here.

Rewrite the code changing the for loop to while without altering its behavior (the output should stay same).

 for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  alert( `number ${i}!` );
}

SOLUTION:

let i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
  alert( `number ${i}!` );
  i++;
}

Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.

The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.

Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.
